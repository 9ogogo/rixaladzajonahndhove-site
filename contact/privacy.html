                    The privacy policy is that I, Rixaladza Jonah Ndhove, shall not under any circumstances share any of your personal data with any third-party for any
                    nefarious reasons such as financial gain, to make fun of your name, or any other weird stuff like that. In order to process the data received on the
                    contact form, however, I do have to use a Google webapp that sends this data to a Google spreadsheet on my Google account.
